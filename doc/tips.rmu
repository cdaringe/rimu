= Rimu Tips

== HTML is valid Rimu
You are free to mix any valid HTML into a Rimu document &mdash; no
special syntax or relearning  is required (in this sense Rimu can be
thought of as an HTML superset).


== Converting Rimu to PDF
Use an HTML to PDF conversion program.
<http://www.htmldoc.org/|HTMLDOC> makes an excellent job, here is
<tips.pdf> generated with this command:

  htmldoc -f doc/tips.pdf  doc/tips.html


== Extend Rimu with Macros
Macros provide a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the Rimu
markup vocabulary. For example the following sidebar:

{sidebar} = '==== $1
.[style="padding-left: 10px; border-left: 4px solid silver;"]'
{info} = '<span class="label label-info">$1</span>'
{heads-up} = '{info|Heads up!}'
{note} = '{info|Note} <mark>$1</mark>'
{playground} = '<http://rimumarkup.org/rimuplayground.html|Rimu Playground>'

{sidebar|Fun with Macros}
..
{heads-up} See the {playground} for documentation and hands-on
experimentation.

{note|This document is not yet finished.}
..

Was generated by this Rimu markup:

.no-highlight
--
\{sidebar} = '==== $1
.[style="padding-left: 10px; border-left: 4px solid silver;"]'
\{info} = '<span class="label label-info">$1</span>'
\{heads-up} = '\{info|Heads up!}'
\{note} = '\{info|Note} <mark>$1</mark>'
\{playground} = '<http://rimumarkup.org/rimuplayground.html|Rimu Playground>'

\{heads-up} See the \{playground} for documentation and hands-on

- The `\{sidebar}` macro illustrates how you can create custom text
  blocks by styling Rimu Division Blocks.
- Note how macro definitions can span multiple lines and can contain
  any valid Rimu markup (including HTML and blank lines).


.#syntax-highlighting
== Syntax highlighting
<https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js|Highlight.js> is a nice
syntax highlighter that makes it trivial to add syntax highlighting to
Rimu code blocks.  The _rimuc_ tool includes Highlight.js when you use
the `--styled` option, it does this by linking to CSS and JavaScript
files on the _Highlight.js_ website.

_Highlight.js_ automatically detects the language in the code block,
but you can also set the language explicitly by setting the code block
class, for example:

  .javascript
  --
  function die(message) {
    console.error(message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  --

Set the `no-highlight` class too disable syntax highlighting for a
code block.


== Syntax shared with Markdown
The following subset of _Rimu_ elements is compatible with Markdown:

Headers:: Headers using `#` character header IDs.

Code blocks:: Indented paragraphs (at least four spaces)
render like Markdown code blocks.

Text formatting:: `_emphasis_` and `\`code\`` quotes.

Lists::
- Bullet lists with `-` and `*` IDs.
- Numbered lists with explicit numbering.

URLs and Email addresses:: Using the `<url>` and `<email>` syntaxes.

The Rimu _README_ uses this subset for compatibility with _GitHub_ and
_npmjs.org_ README formats.


== Escaping Rimu syntax
If you have text that you don't want interpreted as a Rimu element
then you can render it literally (escape it) by prefixing the element
with a backslash character.


== Passing macro values into Rimu documents
You can do this by prepending text containing macro definitions to
Rimu source before rendering the source. The _rimuc_ command has a
`--prepend` option that can be used to do this.

Alternatively you could also put macro definitions in a
separate file and specify it as the first Rimu source file in the
_rimuc_ command.

The following example sets the HTML _title_ in the `kotlin-notes.html`
output document:

  rimuc --styled --prepend "\{title}='Kotlin Notes'" kotlin-notes.rmu


== Putting | and } characters in macro parameter values
Use the corresponding character entities `&vert;` and `&rbrace;`.


== Syntax checker
The Vim editor syntax highlighter is a big help when writing (and
reading) Rimu markup.


== The Rimu markup looks ok but the generated HTML is wrong
Using an editor with Rimu syntax highlighting support (see previous
topic) makes it much easier to spot syntax errors.


== Display contiguous block images vertically
Unless they are separated by other block elements, multiple block
image elements flow inline like text (this is because the HTML `img`
element is an "inline block" element), you can flow them vertically by
enclosing them in a _Division Block_ (HTML `div` element), for
example:

  <image:http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png|W3C logo>
  ..
  .#big-logo [width="150"]
  <image:http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png|W3C logo>
  ..

Renders:

<image:http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png|W3C logo>
..
.#big-logo [width="150"]
<image:http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png|W3C logo>
..


== Entering non-ASCII characters
A number of non-ASCII Unicode characters are commonly used for
punctuation e.g.  em dash, ellipsis and quotation characters. You can
enter these characters (or any Unicode character) as HTML character
entities or you can enter them literally.

For example, to enter an ellipsis you could either enter `&hellip;` or
you could enter the actual … character directly. The mechanism for
entering Unicode characters directly will be dictated your editor:

Vim:: Enter _Ctrl+V_ followed by the the character _u_ followed by the
hexidecimal character code e.g. to enter an em dash enter _Ctrl+V_
followed by _u2014_

Linux console input:: Enter _Ctrl+Shift+U_ followed by the hexadecimal
character code followed by the _Enter_ key.

Common Unicode characters:

  Character     HTML entity    Hexadecimal code
  ---------     -----------    ----------------
  —             &mdash;        2014
  …             &hellip;       2026
  “             &ldquo;        201c
  ”             &rdquo;        201d
  →             &rightarrow;   2192

Here's a full list of
<http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref|HTML5 character
entities>.


== Whitespace and Underscores in URLs
Whitespace characters are illegal in URL paths, use _%20_ in place of
spaces, for example:

  <file:///home/srackham/books/War%20and%20Peace.pdf|War and Peace>

Underscore characters are legal in URL paths but they may be
interpreted as Rimu emphasis quotes, you can use _%5F_ in place of
underscores or escape them with backslashes.
